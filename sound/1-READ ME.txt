Edited by Artem:

I am merging all of our files into one directory. It can always be reeorganized if needbe.


Jay:Artem only asked for a basic collection of sound effects for week one to build up our resevoir. In this file, you have the bulk of the 
self made sound effects I still have. All of these are to be used freely if and where neccessessary. God's speed and good luck!
